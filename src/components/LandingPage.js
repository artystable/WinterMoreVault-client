      <p>Are you a live music junkie who tends to have a huge concert t-shirt collection (as well as other concert merchandise). "WinterMore Valut" solves your problem of how to visually catalog all those t-shirts and other merchandise. You will be able to create a user id and password. You will then be able to create entries for each piece of merchandise. You will be able to upload a picture of your merch, add a date, the artist and any notes you might want to add about the show where the merch was purchased. This will all be presented in a visually appealing Pinterest like cards.</p> 
      
    <p>WinterMore is an ode to Bill Graham the famous concert promoter. In the 60's he created Winterland productions which created the first promotional concert t-shirts. Winterland and the Fillmore were two of the most famous concert venues in the Bay Area (where I am also from) where he produced concerts.</p>
